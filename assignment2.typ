= Introduction

In assignment 2, we investigated a variety of projects both successful and unsuccessful and examined the major factors that impacted it's ultimate outcome. With the conclusion of asssignment 3, we have an opportunity to reflect and evaluate what factors relate to our scenario. 

= Communication

In assignment task 2, I analysed how companies like SpaceX and Dyson were affected by their method and quality of commiunication to their stakeholders. SpaceX's falcon 1 project suffered many initial setbacks, which would normally discourage shareholders and sponsors from offering further support. However, SpaceX managed to instill confidence in stakeholders despite this, by showing tangible progress with each failed launch attempt. They were able to retain many customers thanks to their strong communication and marketing skills. On the other hand, Dyson's Electric Car project suffered from a lack of proper communication with the stakeholders. They were promised the car would meet the requirements however, infrequent communication of technical and financial difficulties left the stakeholders, employees and the public in the dark about the true progress of the car, breaking their trust in the project's success, which contributed to the failure of the project.

In assignment 3, we came across several situations where communication with the stakeholder, which is our tutor in this scenario, was crucially important to ensure that our deliverable met up to the standards
